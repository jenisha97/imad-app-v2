            The origin of the name Oreo is unknown, but there are many theories, including derivations from the French word 'Or', meaning gold (as early packaging was gold),[citation needed] or the Greek word 'Oreo', meaning beautiful, nice or well done.[2] Others believe that the cookie was named Oreo because it was short and easy to pronounce.

                The "Oreo Biscuit" was first developed and produced by the National Biscuit Company (today known as Nabisco) in 1912[4][5] at its Chelsea, Manhattan factory in the current-day Chelsea Market complex, located on Ninth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets.[6] Today, this same block of Ninth Avenue is known as "Oreo Way."
